# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction
This project aims to predict the daily demand for shared bikes in an urban environment using historical data from BoomBikes. 
By analyzing various factors such as season, weather conditions, temperature, and other relevant features, the project builds a multiple linear regression model to understand and quantify the impact of these variables on bike rentals. 

The goal is to help the bike sharing company optimize its operations, plan inventory, and make data-driven decisions to improve service and profitability. 

The approach includes data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation, with a focus on interpreting the results and validating model assumptions. Key findings highlight the importance of seasonality and weather, and the model provides actionable insights for business strategy.

## General Information
- This project predicts the daily demand for shared bikes in a city using historical data from BoomBikes.
- The business problem is to help the bike sharing company understand what factors drive demand and to optimize operations and inventory.
- The dataset used is the BoomBikes day-level data, which includes weather, season, and other features.

## Conclusions
1. The fall season, clear weather, and higher temperatures are the most important factors that increase bike demand.
2. Categorical variables such as season and weather have a strong and clear impact on the number of rentals.
3. The linear regression model built on the cleaned dataset fits the data well, with residuals showing reasonable normality and constant variance.

## Technologies Used
