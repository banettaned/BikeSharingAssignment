## General Information
- This project predicts the daily demand for shared bikes in a city using historical data from BoomBikes.
- The business problem is to help the bike sharing company understand what factors drive demand and to optimize operations and inventory.
- The dataset used is the BoomBikes day-level data, which includes weather, season, and other features.

## Conclusions
1. The fall season, clear weather, and higher temperatures are the most important factors that increase bike demand.
2. Categorical variables such as season and weather have a strong and clear impact on the number of rentals.
3. The linear regression model built on the cleaned dataset fits the data well, with residuals showing reasonable normality and constant variance.

## Technologies Used
- pandas 
- numpy 
- matplotlib 
- seaborn
- statsmodels

## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by the BoomBikes assignment and various online tutorials on regression modeling.
